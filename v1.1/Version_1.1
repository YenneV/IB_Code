v1a

This is Carl's original code v1.0 with the following changes:

Printing to terminal of points added/removed commented out

Printing of iteration number (time point) to terminal added
 
This code should run for tmax = 2000000 with output files for bulk and boundary every 20000th iteration and velocity output to file every 1000th iteration.  If it runs to tmax it should output
100 sets of files plus the initialisation files.

Currently running with following parameters:
surface tension = 0.1
Bulk activity = -0.01
Elastic constant K = 0.01 to 0.05
Interface activity = -0.01
Unbinding rate koff = 0.01
